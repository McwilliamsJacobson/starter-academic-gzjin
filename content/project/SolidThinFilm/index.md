Epitaxial growth is a process in which adatoms are deposited on a substrate and grow a solid thin film on the substrate. Epitaxial growth on crystal surface involves various structures, one of which is described by step flow dynamics driven by misfit elasticity between thin film and the substrate. 

The discrete Burton-Cabrera-Frank (BCF) type models have been proposed by Burton, Cabrera, Frank, Duport, Tersoff, et al.. From the macroscopic view, the governing equations for thin film grow processes are all 4th order degenerate parabolic equations. We focus on the analytic validation of those continuum models by studying the continuum limit from discrete model, global positive solution, strong solutions with latent singularities and long-time behavior of solutions. The detailed evolution of boundary profiles such like facets is still open.
