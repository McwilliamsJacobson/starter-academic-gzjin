abstract: We study the following parabolic nonlocal 4-th order degenerate equation:ut= −[2πH(ux)+ln(uxx+a)+32(uxx+a)2]xx, arising from the epitaxial growth on crystalline materials. HereHdenotes the Hilbert transform, anda>0is a given parameter. By relying on the theory of gradient flows, we first prove the global existence of a vari-ational inequality solution with a general initial datum. Furthermore, to obtain a global strong solution, themain difficulty is the singularity of the logarithmic term whenuxx+aapproaches zero. Thus we show that,if the initial datumu0is such that(u0)xx+ais uniformly bounded away from zero, then such property ispreserved for all positive times. Finally, we will prove several higher regularity results for this global strongsolution. These finer properties provide a rigorous justification for the global-in-time monotone solution tothe epitaxial growth model with nonlocal elastic effects on vicinal surface.
