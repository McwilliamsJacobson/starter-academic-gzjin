abstract: In this work we consider:𝑤𝑡=[(𝑤ℎℎ+𝑐0)−3]ℎℎ,𝑤(0)=𝑤0, which is derived from a thin film equation for epitaxial growth on vicinal surface. We formulate the problem as the gradient flow of a suitably-defined convex functional in a non-reflexive space. Then by restricting it to a Hilbert space and proving the uniqueness of its sub-differential, we can apply the classical maximal monotone operator theory. The mathematical difficulty is due to the fact that whh can appear as a positive Radon measure. We prove the existence of a global strong solution with hidden singularity. In particular, (1) holds almost everywhere when whh is replaced by its absolutely continuous part.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
