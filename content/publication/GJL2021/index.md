abstract: We propose an equilibrium-driven deformation algorithm (EDDA) to simulate the inbetweening transformations starting from an initial image to an equilibrium image, which covers images varying from a greyscale type to a colorful type on planes or manifolds. The algorithm is based on the Fokker-Planck dynamics on manifold, which automatically incorporates the manifold structure suggested by dataset and satisfies positivity, unconditional stability, mass conservation law and exponentially convergence. The thresholding scheme is adapted for the sharp interface dynamics and is used to achieve the finite time convergence. Using EDDA, three challenging examples, (I) facial aging process, (II) coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia invading/fading process, and (III) continental evolution process are computed efficiently.
