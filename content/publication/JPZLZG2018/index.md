abstract: As an effective tool to distinguish different tidal components, classical tidal current harmonic analysis has been widely used to obtain harmonic parameters of internal tidal currents. However, harmonic parameters cannot exactly reveal the motion of internal tides, as the irregular temporal variations for internal tides are significant in many regions of the world’s oceans. An enhanced harmonic analysis (EHA) algorithm based on the independent point scheme and cubic spline interpolation is presented in this paper to obtain harmonic parameters with temporal variations for different tidal constituents of internal tides. Moreover, this algorithm is applied to analyze 14 months of current data obtained from a mooring located on the continental shelf in the northeastern region of the South China Sea. The obvious irregular temporal variations for the four principal constituents— $M_2$, $K_1$, $S_2$, and $O_1$ —of internal tides in this region are indicated. It is hoped that this algorithm might present a brand-new view for researchers to investigate the irregular temporal motions of internal tides.
