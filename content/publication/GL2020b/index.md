abstract: In this paper we study the relaxation process of the Peierls–Nabarro dislocation model, which is a gradient flow with a singular nonlocal energy and a double well potential describing how the materials relax to its equilibrium with the presence of a dislocation. We prove the dynamic solution to the Peierls–Nabarro model will converge exponentially to a shifted steady profile which is uniquely determined.
