abstract: We study in this work a continuum model derived from a one-dimensional attachment-detachment-limited type step flow on a vicinal surface, $ u_t=-u^2(u^3)_{hhhh}, $ where $u$, considered as a function of step height $h$, is the step slope of the surface. We formulate a notion of a weak solution to this continuum model and prove the existence of a global weak solution, which is positive almost everywhere. We also study the long time behavior of the weak solution and prove it converges to a constant solution as time goes to infinity. The space-time Hölder continuity of the weak solution is also discussed as a byproduct.
