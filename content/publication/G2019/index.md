abstract: In this work, we consider the one dimensional very singular fourth-order equation for solid-on-solid model in attachment-detachment-limit regime with exponential nonlinearity $h_{t} = \bigtriangledown \cdot (\frac{1}{\left | \bigtriangledown h \right | } \bigtriangledown e^{\frac{\delta E}{\delta h} } )=\bigtriangledown \cdot (\frac{1}{\left | \bigtriangledown h \right | } -\bigtriangledown e^{-\bigtriangledown \cdot (\frac{\delta E}{\delta h}) } )$ where total energy $E = \int \left | \bigtriangledown h \right |$ is the total variation of $h$. Using a logarithmic correction for total energy $E = \int \left | \bigtriangledown h \right | \ln{\left | \bigtriangledown h \right |}dx$ and gradient flow structure with a suitable defined functional, we prove the one dimensional evolution variational inequality solution preserves a positive gradient $h_x$ which has upper and lower bounds but in BV space. We also obtain the global strong solution to the solid-on-solid model which allows an asymmetric singularity $h_{xx}^{+}$ to happen.
